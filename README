# 💎 Diamond Dynamics: Price Prediction & Market Segmentation

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices and segmenting diamonds into meaningful clusters based on physical and qualitative attributes. It combines Machine Learning, Deep Learning (ANN), and Clustering techniques, and includes an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The diamond industry relies heavily on multiple attributes such as **cut, color, clarity, carat, and dimensions** to determine pricing. This project solves two major business use cases:

### 🔹 1. **Price Prediction**
Predict diamond prices in INR using several ML algorithms including:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- KNN Regressor  
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Models were evaluated using:

| Model | MAE | MSE | RMSE | R² Score |
|-------|-----|-----|------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 8504.23 | 1.65e+08 | 12845.67 | 0.88 |
| Random Forest Regressor | 3125.52 | 3.42e+07 | 5850.56 | 0.97 |
| ANN Model | 3800.45 | 4.75e+07 | 6891.28 | 0.95 |

### 🔹 2. **Clustering (Market Segmentation)**

K-Means clustering groups diamonds into customer-centric categories. PCA was used for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Example cluster names:

| Cluster | Label |
|---------|--------|
| 0 | Affordable Small Diamonds |
| 1 | Mid-Range Balanced Diamonds |
| 2 | Premium Heavy Diamonds |
